# stochastic_dyadic_cantor_set
This program simulates the random construction and fragmentation of a stochastic Cantor set, where at each step an interval is chosen and split at a random point, and with probability `p` the right sub-interval is kept (otherwise only the left sub-interval is retained); this process is iterated for a specified number of steps (`t`) and repeated over multiple ensemble runs to obtain statistical averages. After all simulations, the distribution of interval lengths is computed and output as both collapsed and log-log scaled histograms, saved to files named according to the simulation parameters. This framework allows for the exploration of scaling and statistical properties of random fractals, particularly focusing on the evolution of interval length distributions in a stochastic Cantor set, and is useful for studies in fractal geometry and stochastic fragmentation.
